# Current Tasks

Active experiments. See `README.md` for everything completed so far and the
overall pipeline.
## consider probing at the layers to see if they are actually encoding information

## consider different types of steering

## consider different generative models

## Known bugs / to fix

### relax resume trusts stale `relaxed/<stem>.parquet` (data contamination)
`relax_steered_cifs.py` resumes by merging any existing
`steering_results/relaxed/<stem>.parquet` on `(id, sample)` and skipping rows that
already have `cif_relaxed`. It **never checks that the reused `cif_relaxed` was
produced from the current `cif_steered`.** If a stem is regenerated (generation is
stochastic at temperature 1.0, so a re-run yields different structures for the same
prompt), the old relaxed structures no longer correspond to the new `cif_steered`,
but resume keeps them anyway → contaminated relaxed rows feed wrong structures into
`predict_bandgap.py`.

Hit on 2026-07-13: α16 with-SG and α40 with-SG were regenerated to full 30k on
Jul-12 but still had Jun-2 900-row relaxed files; the relax jobs resumed and reused
~850 stale relaxed structures each. Fixed immediately by deleting those two relaxed
files and resubmitting (see below), but the underlying resume logic is still unsafe.

**Fix idea:** guard the resume — only reuse a relaxed row if the source `cif_steered`
matches (e.g. store a hash of `cif_steered` alongside `cif_relaxed`, or refuse to
resume when the relaxed file is older than the generated_cifs file for that stem).

## Backlog / not started
- Predict alpha = 11/25 relaxed files (already relaxed in `steering_results/relaxed/`, no
  prediction columns yet) to fill in the full alpha sweep table.
